# Mars Rover Simulation

This project is a simulation of NASA's Mars Rovers navigating a rectangular plateau. Each rover follows a set of instructions to explore the terrain, and the final positions and orientations of the rovers are displayed.

## Features

- **Grid-based plateau navigation**: The plateau is defined as a rectangular grid.
- **Rover movement**: Rovers can move forward and rotate 90 degrees left or right.
- **Custom input**: Users can define the plateau size, rover positions, and movement instructions.
- **Sequential execution**: Rovers execute instructions one at a time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
